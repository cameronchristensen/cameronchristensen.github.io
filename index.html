                <p class="bio-info"> Hello and welcome to my portfolio website.
                    My name is Cameron Christensen, I was born in Riverton, Utah
                     and and have lived in Utah my entire life. Currently, I am a 
                     government employee looking for a career change into the web 
                     development world. Some of my aspirations as a web developer 
                     would be to create massive and marvelous websites 
                     for clients and companies to enjoy. I love to travel and enjoy
                     seeing parts of the world where history has played a major role.
                     For example, some of the places that I have visited are Germany, Denmark
                     Czech Republic, Italy, and Greece. Each of the places has a rich history
                     and are filled with amazing stories. 
                </p>
                <p class="bio-info">
                    On another trip, I went to Africa to visit a family friend and while 
                    doing so, I was able to do some service as well. It was an amazing experience. 
                    Many people there don't have running water, but yet they are so happy 
                    with what they do have, it's incredible. Sometimes I wonder if we should
                    try to live like them so we don't take the modern conveniences we have for 
                    granted.
